# Facial Recognition From Images

 This projest is a python code that learn to detect people from an image database and try to detect people on images you give 


# How to use it 

- First upload pictures of people you would like the python code to recognize. Then you rename this image so that the code can know who is in the pictue (in my example I name the photo starting with '1....jpg' for a photo of Cardi B for instance).

- Then you run the trainner.py code and the images from the database will scroll on the screen.

- Finally you place the image you want the code to predict in the test_images folder. Then You launch the detector.py code and the image to test will appear with the name of the person.
